kmeans
======

An package for finding the optimal K for K means clustering for a given set of n-dimensional data points.

Implemented for Baylor College of Medicine Scientific Programmer I Assignment.

## Assignment Description

K means clustering is often used as an unsupervised data-analytics algorithm meant to find the ideal number of possible classes in a given dataset.

Your job is to implement a k-means clustering algorithm pipeline that takes in dataset file(s) such as the one found in the dataset folder and compute the best K for each dataset and output into another text file the file name followed by the estimated K for each one.

You are only allow to use numpy package, all other packages are prohibited.
Each line in the dataset file represent 1, n dimensional datapoint. We gave you one file to establish the format the test cases will be in.

Write the code to accomplish the task above as well make package it into a python package where we can install it and use it different codebase. (Should be pip3 installable)
You should share the code on GitHub so we can clone it on our side.
